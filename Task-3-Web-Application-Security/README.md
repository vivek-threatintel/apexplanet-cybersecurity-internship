# Task 3 — Web Application Security

## Objective

The objective of this task is to understand and demonstrate common web application security vulnerabilities in a controlled laboratory environment using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA).

The task covers vulnerability identification, basic source-code analysis, security-level comparison, and practical testing.

---

## Lab Environment

- Kali Linux
- Apache HTTP Server
- PHP
- MariaDB
- Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- Web Browser
- Burp Suite

All vulnerability testing is performed against the local DVWA instance.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. SQL Injection

SQL Injection testing and source-code analysis, including the use of prepared statements.

Detailed notes:

`sql-injection/sql-injection.md`

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Testing of Stored XSS and Reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

Detailed notes:

`xss/xss.md`

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Testing of password-change requests and comparison of CSRF protection across DVWA security levels.

Detailed notes:

`csrf/csrf.md`

### 4. File Inclusion

Testing and analysis of Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

Detailed notes:

`file-inclusion/file-inclusion.md`

### 5. Burp Suite

Advanced web application testing using Burp Suite, including HTTP request interception and analysis.

Detailed notes:

`burp-suite/burp-suite.md`

### 6. Web Security Headers

Analysis of HTTP security headers and their role in improving web application security.

Detailed notes:

`security-headers/security-headers.md`
